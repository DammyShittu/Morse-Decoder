# Morse Code Decoder

> This is a project from the second week of the fourth module of the Microverse Program.

This program consists of a decoder that can run in your command line. It can take a **string** input and return a decoded message. Introduce a message in morse code using "." and "-". Characters in the code are separated by single spaces, and words in the message are separated by three spaces. After successfully providing a morse-coded message, the program will print the decoded message in the console.

## Getting Started

- Make sure you have `Ruby` installed in your system. You can install it [here](https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/documentation/installation/
).

- Clone this repository by running `git clone https://github.com/DammyShittu/Morse-Decoder.git` in your command line.

- Navigate to the repository by running `cd Morse-Decoder`.

- Run the decoder by running `ruby morse_decoder` on the command line. The program will prompt for a message in morse code and will return a decoded message in full uppercase.

## Optional

- Run `bundle install` to install the `Ruby Gems` including `Rubocop`.
